# SharePoint DOCX Optimiser

Cut oversized “Detailed design” Word files, remove SVG bloat, slash storage.

---

## What it does
* Finds **.docx** files named *Detailed design* above a chosen size  
* Downloads locally, converts embedded **SVG** images to resized **PNG**  
* Rewrites relationships inside the file, deletes original SVGs  
* Uploads the lighter file back, retrying three ways if SharePoint argues  
* Tracks progress, speed, and writes a full **size-reduction report**  
* Runs safely in **-TestMode** to process just 5 files
